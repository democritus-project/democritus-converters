Democritus functions<sup>[1]</sup> for easily converting dates, times, temperatures, and distances.

[1] Democritus functions are <i>simple, effective, modular, well-tested, and well-documented</i> Python functions.

We use `d8s` (pronounced "dee-eights") as an abbreviation for `democritus` (you can read more about this [here](https://github.com/democritus-project/roadmap#what-is-d8s)).

## Installation

```
pip install d8s-converters
```

## Usage

You import the library like:

```python
from d8s_converters import *
```

Once imported, you can use any of the functions listed below.
